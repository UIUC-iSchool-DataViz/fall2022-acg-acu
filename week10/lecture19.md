  We'll discuss a bit about updating vega-lite visualizations using their API in Starboard, and we'll move on to looking at GeoJSON data in Jupyter and what it looks like.
---

## Visualization Reports

---

## Today

 * vega-lite API
 * Geo data formats 

---

## Why update data?

 * Reaction to new, incoming data
 * Modify based on some set of inputs that can't be bound to vega-lite events
 * Static visualization, changing view

---

## Updating Data in vega-lite

We can change the visible data in vega-lite.  We'll do this with some simple data, and then try our hand at a simple role playing game.

---

## Embedded vega-lite config

We are principally using a vega-lite "embed" mechanism:

```javascript
var embedded = vegaEmbed('#vis', yourVlSpec);
```

We are also able to specify a configuration variable to this at the config
option.  ([Details](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed))  You may find it
useful to update the `actions` option in `opt`, which controls which items are
available in the menu:

```javascript
var embedded = vegaEmbed('#vis', yourVlSpec, {'actions': false});
```

---

## Accessing embedded vega-lite

The object returned by `vegaEmbed` is a
[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
This means that when you access it, it may not *yet* be available -- so instead
of actually calling on it, we supply a function to be called *at some point*
when it is ready -- when the promise has been __resolved__.  This function will
be called with that object.

```javascript
somePromiseObject.then( function(resolvedObject) {
  resolvedObject.doSomething();
});
```

(This type of syntax, for deferring actions to the future, is very common in
Javascript.)

---

## Accessing embedded vega-lite with Starboard

In some cases, you can use what's known as an `await` command to wait for the
promise to return successfully.  We can use this in starboard:

```javascript
var embedded = await vegaEmbed("#vis", yourVlSpec);
```

We will attempt to use both forms, to provide information on using vega-lite in
various different contexts.

---

## The vega-lite View API

The [`View` API](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_insert) in
vega-lite (rather, vega) is how we manipulate and change data.  This can be
done by constructing a `changeset`, appending operations to that changeset, and
then executing that changeset on the `view` of our embedded visualization.

```javascript
var cs = vega.changeset()
          .remove( function(t) {
              return t.CIRCULATION < 10000
          });
embedded.then( function(res) {
  res.view.change('table', cs).run();
});
```

This will update the data table named `'table'` with everything "queued up" in
the `changeset` object `cs`.

---

## vega-lite: insert example

```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v3.json",
    "description": "A scatterplot",
    "data": {"name": "table",
             "values": [ {"x": 1.0, "y": 2.0},
                         {"x": 2.0, "y": 1.0},
                         {"x": 3.0, "y": 9.0},
                         {"x": 4.0, "y": 8.0},
                         {"x": 5.0, "y": 6.0} ] },
    "mark": "point",
      "encoding": {
        "x": {"field": "x","type": "quantitative"},
        "y": {"field": "y","type": "quantitative"}
      }
  }
```

<div id="vis2"></div>

---

## vega-lite: insert example

We can add elements to our dataset with the `insert` function.  This takes an
array of data tuples, like those already included, and adds them to the data
being visualized.

```javascript
var cs = vega.changeset()
          .insert( [
            {'x': 1.0, 'y': 10.0},
            {'x': 5.0, 'y': 1.3},
            {'x': 2.1, 'y': 0.7}
          ]);
embedded3.then( function(res) {
  res.view.change('table', cs).run();
```

---

## vega-lite: insert example

We do this by affixing an event handler, in this case to a button and the event
`click`.

```javascript
document.getElementById("button3")
  .addEventListener("click", 
    function onButtonClick(event) {
  });
```

<div id="vis3"></div>
<button id="button3">Click to insert</button>

---

## vega-lite: remove

Similarly, we can *remove* data points by supplying a function that is
evaluated on each of the data tuples.

```javascript
var cs = vega.changeset()
          .insert( [
            {'x': 1.0, 'y': 10.0},
            {'x': 5.0, 'y': 1.3},
            {'x': 2.1, 'y': 0.7}
            ])
          .remove( function(t) {
            return t.x < t.y;
          });
embedded4.then( function(res) {
  res.view.change('table', cs).run();
```

---

## vega-lite: remove
  
<div id="vis4"></div>
<button id="button4">Click to insert and remove</button>

(Wait, what happened ...?)

---

## Example 1

We're going to set up a contrived example.  In [iodide](https://starboard.gg/) we will:

 1. Create a simple HTML report
 2. Create a listener button for adding a new data point
 3. Create a listener button for removing a random data point

---

## Example 2 (Advanced-ish)

We're going to create a "Character Widget" to show characteristics, like in an RPG, of a set of characters.

We'll add buttons to update their hit points.

## GeoJSON I - Intro

http://geojson.org/ and http://geojson.io/

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Dinagat Islands"
  }
}
```

---

## GeoJSON II - Primitive Types

GeoJSON defines several primitive types:

 * `Point` with associated `coordinates` (single set of two)
 * `LineString` with associated `coordinates` that are lists of two items each
 * `Polygon` with holes able to be cut out of it

Multi-part types are defined out of these.

---

## GeoJSON III - MultiPart Types

These are combined into multi-part types as follows:

 * `MultiPoint`
 * `MultiLineString`
 * `MultiPolygon`

---

## Example: Champaign Data

Go to champaignil.gov .  We will visualize some of this data, such as:

 * Trees
 * Zoning
 * etc...

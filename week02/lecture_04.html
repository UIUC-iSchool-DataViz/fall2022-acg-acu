                ## Topics
                
                - Types of data
                - Operational Palette
                - Components can be controlled in a visualization.

                ---

                ## Types of data

                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/data2viz/data2viz_1.svg" width="3000"/>

                - Numerical/quantitative
                - Categorical/qualitative

                Note:
                - Discover problems in the data
                - Understanding data types is important beacuse the data type decides what operations are allowed to perform on the values.
                - Focus on the two baisc types

                ---

                ## Numerical and Quantitative

                - Numerical values
                  - Number of roomates you have, room temperature
                
                - Discrete data
                  - Countable, finite values
                  - Separable
                  - Number of students in a class, number of palyers in a game
                
                - Continuous data
                  - Measurable
                  - Continuous set of values
                  - Weight, length, frequency, etc.
                
                ---

                ## Categorical and Qualitative

                - Data cannot be expressed as a number.
                  - Dialogues (text, audio), Symbols
                  - Categories (cat, dog)
                
                - Nominal data
                  - Something can be named.
                  - Smartphone brands (Apple, Samsung, LG), Countries

                - Ordinal data
                  - Values have some kind of relative positions
                  - Things can be placed in order or rank.
                  - Likert scale 

                ---

                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/data2viz/data2viz_2.svg" width="3000"/>

                Note:
                - We have went through how data is stored and the basic types of data.
                
                In the process of making a visualization,
                - Sometimes it is not desired to plot the data as-is. 
                - One outlier that differs from other observations very large and make all the other observations squeezed at the bottom of the graph.

                ---
                
                ### Operations can be applied to data

                - Filter 
                - Mutation
                - Grouping
                - Splitting 

                ---

                ### Filtering Operations
                - Relationships
                  - Equality, inequality
                  - Range filter (less than, greater than)
                  - Intersection, disjoint
                - Sampling
                  - Randomized sampling
                  - Regular sampling
                  - Weighted sampling
                - Related data queries
                  - Queries on other columns at fixed row location
                  - External membership queries

                ---

                ### Relationship examples
                - Equality 
                  - Equal/not equal to a value
                    ```PYTHON
                        value == 10
                        value == 'Monday'

                        value != 10
                    ```
                - Range filter 
                  - Less than (or equal)
                  - Greater than (or equal)
                  - "Comes before" and "Comes after"
                    ```PYTHON
                        value > 10
                        1 < value <= 10
                        value > May 1, 2020
                    ```
                
                ---

                ### Relationship examples
                - Set-based operations
                  - "Is a member"
                  - "Is not a member"
                  - "Shares members"
                  - "Shares no members"
                  ```python
                      value in (1, 3, 5)
                      value not in ("Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday")
                  ```

                ---

                ---

                ### Sampling
                - What's the purpose of sampling?
                - Distribution of group members in the sample and in the population.
                  - Preserve original distribution
                  - Balanced number of members in two (or more) groups
                - Order of records in the dataset 
                  - Regular sampling with an interval of 3 but the data happens to be [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ....]

                ---

                ### Mutation Operations
                - Injective operations    
                    What do you observe from the graph?
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/log_transform.svg"/>

                Note:
                Sometimes plotting the data as-is makes the graph hard to read
                Injective operations: maps distinct elements to distinct elements

                ---
                ### Mutation Operations
                - Injective operations
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/Additive_Multiplicative.svg" width="3000"/>

                ---
                ### Mutation Operations
                - Injective operations
                - Smoothing (reduction; not injective)
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/smooth_moving_avg.svg" width="3500"/>
                  
                  - [weather observations in the past 72 hours](https://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KCMI.html)
                - Histograms (reduction; not injective)

                ---
                ### Aggregate

                We can aggregate data points according to their position along defined dimensions.
                - Count
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/counts.svg" width="3000"/>

                ---
                ### Aggregate

                - Sum 
                  - (x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn)
                  - Total number of visitors in a year
                
                - Average
                  - (x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn)/n
                  - Average visitors of a year
                
                - Weighted Average
                  - (x1w1 + x2w2 + x3w + ... + xnwn)/(w1 + w2 + w3 + ... + wn)
                  - Average number of visitors, weighted by monthly visitor counts
                
                ---
                ### Binning and Histograms
                Make data points into a continuous distribution

                ---
                ### Binning and Histograms
                Make data points into a continuous distribution
                - Uniform-width bins
                - Non-uniform bins
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/binning_non-uniform.svg" width="3000"/>


                ---
                ### Splitting
                - We can split data based on some characteristic.
                <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/splitting.svg" width="6000"/>
                
                ---
                ### Dimensions of Representation 
                Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different components of its representation.

                - Position                               
                    <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/position.svg" width="70%" style="margin-left:50%;">
                  
                Note:
                Datum: a piece of information

                ---
                ### Dimensions of Representation 
                Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different components of its representation.

                - Color
                    <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TK-Hsiao/TK-Hsiao.github.io/master/example_viz/color.svg" width="70%" style="margin-left:50%;">

                ### Dimensions of Representation 
                Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different components of its representation.

                - Size

                ---
                ### Scales and Scaling
                Displaying a quantity requires assigning to it a given representation. 
                - Color varies according to the quantity (e.g. heatmap)
                - Size varies according to the quantity (e.g. bubble plot)

                In mathematical notation, we first "normalize" our data value by assigning to a range:   
                g(v)→v′∈[0,1]    
                and then, given a color mapping function, assign to this a given color:    
                f(v′)→(R,G,B)

                Reflection activity:
                [Billionaires in the US states](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-wealthiest-billionaire-in-each-u-s-state-in-2022/)

                - What types of data can be observed from the visualization?
                - What operations mighted be performed on the data?
                  - For example, scaling

                ---
                - Does this data describe a geometric object?
                - Are the data points *connected* to each other?
                - Can we describe data points with a fixed set of *categories*?
                - Is there a *quantity* associated with the data?
                - Are the datapoints *continuous* along one or more dimensions?
